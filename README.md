# Overview
The goal of this project is to visualize belly button microbial data. we are helping Rosa complete a data analysis as well as visualizing her data for the public understanding.
She is a biological researcher. She believes there is a microorganism, that provide protein. 
She wants to build a dashboard that built her research participant to identify a viable bacteria species that can synthesize a protein that tastes like beef. 
Improbable beef has gathered demographic and belly button data from 153 volunteers. Since bacteria in the same location in the human body may vary, we will use this data to create Visualization that will help quickly identify people that may have bacteria that can be used to synthesize beef. At the end of the analysis, we will produce three Visualizations:
* a bar chart that visualizes the top 10 bacterial species found in the volunteers' belly buttons
* a bubble chart that emphasizes bacterial species with the highest concentration per individual
* a gauge chart that displays belly washing frequency per week for each volunteer.
Suppose Improbable Beef identifies a bacterial species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef; in that case, our Visualization will help to determine whether that species is found in the navel of any one of the volunteers.
## Resources
* javascript, HTML, Bootstrap, Visual Code, Browser Edge
* data for table from sample.json, index.html
## Control Flow
### Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Deliverable 1 Instructions Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.
### Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
Deliverable 2 Instructions Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:
### Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
Deliverable 3 Instructions Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
### Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard 
Deliverable 4 Instructions Use your knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap to customize the webpage for your dashboard.
Customize your dashboard with three of the following: Add an image to the jumbotron. Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage. Use a custom font with contrast for the colors. Add more information about the project as a paragraph on the page. Add information about what each graph visualizes, either under or next to each graph. Make the webpage mobile-responsive. Change the layout of the page. Add a navigation bar that allows you to select the bar or bubble chart on the page. When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940’s data should be displayed in the dashboard, and the three charts should be working according to their requirements. When a sample is selected, the dashboard should display the data in the panel and all three charts according to their requirements.
